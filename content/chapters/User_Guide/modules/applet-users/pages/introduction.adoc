Welcome to the akaun-platform User Manual! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the various features and functionalities of our platform. Let's get started.




[#h4_user_guide_your_akaun_id]
== 1. Creating your AkaunID

To begin using the akaun-platform, you'll need to sign up for an AkaunID. Simply visit https://akaun.com/ and follow the registration process. It's important to note that with a single AkaunID, you can have multiple sign-in methods. You can choose to sign in with your email and password, use a phone number with the same password, or even add access keys for seamless integration.

[#h4_user_guide_prod_staging_dev]
== 2. Understanding the Environments

The akaun-platform operates in three distinct environments, each serving a specific purpose:

- Production Environment: This is the live environment used by real businesses for their day-to-day operations. It can be accessed at https://akaun.com/ with the custom domain https://<something>.akaun.net.

- Staging Environment: The staging environment is primarily used for testing purposes by customers and project managers. It allows end users to try out new features before they are deployed to the production environment. Access it at https://akaun.cloud/ with the custom domain https://<something>.akaun.app.

- Development Environment: The development environment is dedicated to software developers for experimentation and testing. It provides a sandbox environment to explore the platform's capabilities. Access it at https://akaun.dev/ with the custom domain https://<something>.akaun.xyz.

Please remember that registering an AkaunID in the Production environment does not automatically register the same AkaunID in the Staging environment and vice versa.
