= Applet Settings - Server Side Permission

== 1.1 Permission Wizard [In Progress]

Permission Wizard displays a list of  permissions templates whose lines contain one of the targets (company, branch, location). The main functionality of Permission Wizard is to generate permission sets for all selected companies/ branches/ locations. There is also a checkbox for users to check if they want to auto generate roles.

== 1.2 Permission Set

image::Permission_Set_Listing.png[Listing, align = "center"]

=== 1.2.0 Permission Set Listing

Upon clicking into the Permission Set, there will be a list of Permission Set being displayed. Each Permission Set belongs to a Permission Template and can consist of one or more Permission Set Lines. Each Permission Set serves a different purpose but mostly based on CRUD operations. For example, there are different Permission Sets for branches to create, read, update and delete. 

For each of these Permission Sets, there will be at least one or more permission set lines which consists of the permission lines configured to the targets. Targets can be a company, branch or location. By doing so, the targets are given permissions to perform certain operations.

ONLY users with ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have Read and Update access to assign permissions to users in other ranks such as MEMBER. Users who have MEMBER ranks only have READ permissions.

=== 1.2.1 Create Permission Set

Click on the “+” button to create a permission set.

image::Add_Permission_Set.png[Permission Set, align = "center"]

In this tab, the details to be filled are as follow:
Perm Set Name* : The name for the Permission Set.
Perm Set Code*: The code for the Permission Set.
Perm Template*: The permission template which contains the permission line required.
Configure Permission Targets*: A new listing of permission set lines will appear for users to select.
Description [OPTIONAL]: Description of the Permission Set.
Status*: ACTIVE / INACTIVE

All fields with the * symbol indicates information that is compulsory to be filled up by users in order to create the Permission Set.

image::Save_Configured_Permission_Set.png[Permission Set, align = "center"]

Users will then be directed back to the “Add Permission Set” tab. The Configure Permission Targets field will have ‘CONFIGURED’ shown meaning that the target has successfully been configured. Users can repeat the steps for each Permission Set Line and assign a target to it respectively. 

When all Permission Targets have been configured, users can click on the “Save” button to save the respective Permission Set.


Important Note:
To assign the same permission set to multiple targets, users will need to create multiple different permission sets. Each permission set will consist of the same permission lines but can have a different naming convention. Users will have to assign each permission set to one respective target. The faster and easier way is to use the Permission Wizard to generate permission sets.
