= 6.0 Product/Items Management and Synchronization

* Doc Item Maintenance Applet is used to create the item and sync it to the Marketplace.


* The users can create items (Single, Bundle, Group) under Doc Item Maintenance Applet

** Single Item refers to a basic item. Users can create the item manually in the Doc Item Maintenance applet or synced from EMP


** Bundle Item refers to Two or more complementary products grouped together and sold as one set of items. In the marketplace, a bundle item is considered a single item since there is no way that the user is able to specify what the item consists of. To create a bundle item in the marketplace, the user needs to create a new item to specify the set of items that are considered as one package


** Group Item refers to an item that is part of a group of related products that share common attributes like features, use, production processes, etc. It could also sometimes be the market or customer segment in which these products are sold or the prices at which they are offered. When selecting GROUPED ITEM as an item type, users can add additional child items under EDIT.



* For Group and Bundle items, the user needs to choose the child item. This can be done by going to the item listing and clicking on any bundle item or group item. This will open the edit tab where the user can go to Bundle Item Config/Group Item Config and click on the Create button to add the child items.


* In order to add any single item from the listing to a marketplace, the user can select that item, go to the Marketplace tab, and add that item to any marketplace. Users can also configure any marketplace in this tab by selecting the marketplace and choosing the Category, Images, Attributes, and Information. This can only be done when the item has not already been synced to the marketplace.
