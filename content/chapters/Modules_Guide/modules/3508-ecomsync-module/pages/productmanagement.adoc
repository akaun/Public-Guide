The user can create the basic item directly in the Doc Item Maintenance applet. Simply click on the '+' icon in the items menu and fill up all the required information to create a basic/single item. Once all required fields are filled up, users can press on CREATE, so the item will be saved into the database and can proceed to be edited.

=== 6.1.2 Create Bundle Item

* Two or more complementary products are grouped together and sold as one set of items. eg, Selling a laptop together with a mouse, keyboard, and headphones as 1 package. In the marketplace, a bundle item is considered as a single item since there is no way that the user is able to specify what the item consists of. Therefore, we will use the item code = marketplace seller SKU/parent SKU.

* To create a bundle item in the marketplace, the user needs to create a new item to specify the set of items that are considered as one package. Simply click on the '+' icon in the items menu and fill up all the required information to create a bundle item. Once all required fields are filled up, users can press on CREATE, so the item will be saved into the database and can proceed to be edited.

In the edit item page, users need to go to the ‘bundle config’ tab to add the child for the bundle item. Click on the '+' button and select which item to be included in this bundle item. It can only consist of basic items. Tick the items by multiple select and click add. Once an item is added, you may click on the item to remove it or update the ratio of the item units. The ratio refers to the number of items (ie: 2 eggs selling as a bundle. The ratio will be 2). After done, click on the save.

=== 6.1.3 Create Grouped Products

Grouped Item is an item that is part of a group of related products which share common attributes like features, use, production processes, etc. It could also sometimes be the market or customer segment in which these products are sold or the prices at which they are offered. When selecting GROUPED ITEM as an item type, users can add additional child items under the EDIT page.

To create a grouped item in the marketplace, the user needs to create a new item to group all the single items as one. Click on the '+' icon in the items menu. Fill up all the required information to create a grouped item. Once all required fields are filled up, users can press on CREATE button, so the item will be saved into the database and can proceed to be edited.

In the edit item page, users need to go to the ‘child item’ tab to add the child to the grouped item. Click on the '+' button and select which item to be included in this grouped item. It may consist of basic items and bundle items. (REMEMBER: For the marketplace, the seller SKU cannot be duplicated. Basic/bundle items that already sync to the marketplace cannot be synced again via grouped items). Tick the items by multiple select and click add. Once an item is added, you may click on the item to remove it. The price and quantity can be ignored as we will set it separately at the marketplace later. After done, click save.
