AUTO (buffer stock)

Stock 
Availability = Total stock balance from multi-location - buffer stock - sale order (depend on configuration)

AUTO (balance percentage)

Stock Availability = (Total stock balance from multi-location - sale order (depend on configuration)) x balance percentage

MANUAL

Stock Availability = Manual stock balance - sale order (depend on configuration)
Example calculation as below ;

image::Ecomsync-13.png[align = center]

Scenario 1

AUTO with buffer stock ; 3 units and sale order; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :

Item A = 15 stocks -3 buffer -2 orders= 10 units

Item B = 15 stocks -3 buffer -3 orders = 9 units

Scenario 2

AUTO with stock balance percentage ; 50% and sale order ; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :

Item A = (15 stocks - 2 orders) x 50% = 6 units

Item A = (15 stocks - 3 orders) x 50% = 6 units

Scenario 3

MANUAL with stock balance; 7 units and sale order; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :

Item A = 7 stocks - 2 orders = 5 units

Item A = 7 stocks - 3 orders = 4 units
