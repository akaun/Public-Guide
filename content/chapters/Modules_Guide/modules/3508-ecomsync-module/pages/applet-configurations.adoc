b. AUTO (balance percentage)
- Stock Availability = (Total stock balance from multi-location - sale order (depend on configuration)) x balance percentage
c. MANUAL
- Stock Availability = Manual stock balance - sale order (depend on configuration)

Example calculation as below:

image::Example-Calculation.png[align = center]

1. Scenario 1
AUTO with buffer stock ; 3 units and sale order ; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :
Item A = 15 stocks -3 buffer -2 orders= 10 units
Item B = 15 stocks -3 buffer -3 orders = 9 units


2. Scenario 2
AUTO with stock balance percentage ; 50% and sale order ; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :
Item A = (15 stocks - 2 orders) x 50% = 6 units
Item A = (15 stocks - 3 orders) x 50% = 6 units

3. Scenario 3
MANUAL with stock balance ; 7 units and sale order ; ACTIVE
Stock Availability :
Item A = 7 stocks - 2 orders = 5 units
Item A = 7 stocks - 3 orders = 4 units
