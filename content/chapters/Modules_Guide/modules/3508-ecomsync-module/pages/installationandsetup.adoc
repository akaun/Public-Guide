== 4.2 Configurations and Integration

=== 4.2.2 Doc Item Maintenance Applet

* Users need to create items in the Doc Item Maintenance Applet and sync it to the Marketplace.


* CREATE ITEM - items can be created manually or synced from EMP (if the user is currently using Wavelet EMP)


* Wavelet EMP user - The user need to create the basic item in their EMP and it will be synced back to the Doc Item Maintenance applet by ETL.


* Non-wavelet EMP user - The user can create the basic item directly in the Doc Item Maintenance applet.

There are *3 types of Items* which are Single, Group, and Bundle items.

1. *Single Item* - refers to a basic item, this is the default type that is relevant to most      items. 

* Wavelet EMP user - The user need to create the basic item in their EMP and it will be synced back
* Kindly ensure that the EMP item code = marketplace seller sku/parent sku. Ie: [ABC] = [ABC]


image::1-Doc-Item.png[align = center]

2. *Bundle Item* -  refers to Two or more complementary products grouped together and sold as one set of items. Ie : Selling a laptop together with mouse, keyboard, headphone as 1 package.

* In the marketplace, a bundle item is considered as a single item since there is no way that the user is able to specify what the item consists of. Therefore, we will use the item code = marketplace seller sku/parent sku. Ie: [BND] [ITEM A,2] [ITEM B] [ITEM C] = need 2 quantities of item A and one quantity of item B,C

3. Grouped Item - An item that is part of a group of related products which share common attributes like features, use, production processes etc. It could also sometimes be the market or customer segment in which these products are sold or the prices at which they are offered.


* To create an item in the marketplace , the user needs to create a new item to specify the set of item that consider as one package (applicable to all user ; EMP and non-EMP).


*Steps* outline the general process *for creating all types of items* in the marketplace, whether they are single, bundled, or grouped.
* Click on the '+' icon in the Items menu. Create an item tab will be appeared.
