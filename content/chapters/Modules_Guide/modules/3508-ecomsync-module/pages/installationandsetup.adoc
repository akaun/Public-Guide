=== 2.2.2 Doc Item Maintenance Applet

- Doc Item Maintenance Applet is used to create the item and sync it to the Marketplace. 

- There are 3 types of Items which are Single, Group, and Bundle items.


** Single Item refers to a basic item. Users can create the item manually in the Doc Item Maintenance applet or synced from EMP

** Bundle Item refers to Two or more complementary products grouped together and sold as one set of items. In the marketplace, a bundle item is considered a single item since there is no way that the user is able to specify what the item consists of. To create a bundle item in the marketplace, the user needs to create a new item to specify the set of items that are considered as one package


** Group Item refers to an item that is part of a group of related products that share common attributes like features, use, production processes, etc. It could also sometimes be the market or customer segment in which these products are sold or the prices at which they are offered. When selecting GROUPED ITEM as an item type, users can add additional child items under EDIT. 

* For Group and Bundle items, the user needs to choose the child item. This can be done by going to the item listing and clicking on any bundle item or group item. This will open the edit tab where the user can go to Bundle Item Config/Group Item Config and click on the Create button to add the child items. 

* In order to add any single item from the listing to a marketplace, the user can select that item, go to the Marketplace tab, and add that item to any marketplace. Users can also configure any marketplace in this tab by selecting the marketplace and choosing the Category, Images, Attributes, and Information. This can only be done when the item has not already been synced to the marketplace.

* In order to add any group item from the listing to a marketplace, the user can select that item, go to the Marketplace tab, select the marketplace you want to add the item to and select the attributes and child items. Each child item in the listing needs to be configured in order to sync the group item to the marketplace.

* The Stock Availability tab has all the branch listings that are synced to the marketplace. Users can pull stock from any branch in the listing and you can also select if you want to Auto pull the stock from the branch or Manually. For Manual stock pulling, the user has to set a Buffer Number or Stock Balance Percentage. Users can also choose the location/warehouse or cross-company.

* In Order to see the details of the end customer, you can select any sales order and go to the Account tab where you can see Entity Details, Bill To, and Ship To details, 

== 2.3 Pricing Scheme

The Pricing Scheme can be set in the Doc Item Maintenance Applet. Users can define different pricing schemes based on each marketplace, tailoring their pricing strategies to specific market dynamics. The beauty of Ecomsync lies in its ability to sync the pricing scheme with all connected marketplaces. This means you can choose a specific pricing scheme for a product and seamlessly sync it across your multi-channel landscape.
