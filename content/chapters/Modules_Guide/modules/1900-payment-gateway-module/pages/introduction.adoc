The transaction initiation begins with the CP-Commerce Web Browser transmitting vital parameters—comprising the Reference Number, Amount, Remarks, Merchant Indirect URL, Error Indirect URL, and Merchant Contract Key—to the CP-Commerce Backend. Upon receipt, the CP-Commerce Backend expeditiously processes the information and reciprocates by conveying the Reference Number back to the CP-Commerce Web Browser. Subsequently, armed with the Reference Number, the web browser instigates an HTTP request to the Payment Gateway (PGW) Backend. The PGW Backend, in turn, furnishes an HTML page to the PGW Web Browser, eliciting the customer's selection of a preferred payment channel. Upon selection, the transaction seamlessly transitions to the chosen payment channel's backend, such as Ipay88 or Xampay. For Xampay, where no backend is present, the payment seamlessly advances from the PGW directly to Maybank. The subsequent orchestration involves interactions between the payment channel's backend, associated web browser, the Maybank backend, and web browser, with iterative movements based on the intricacies of banking processes. The flow eventually returns through the PGW Backend, PGW Web Browser, and CP-Commerce Backend, culminating in the CP-Commerce website through seamless redirection.
