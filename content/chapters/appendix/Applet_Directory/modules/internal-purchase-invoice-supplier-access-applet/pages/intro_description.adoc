The Internal Purchase Invoice Supplier Access Applet is used by suppliers to view finalised purchase invoices created by their customers. It provides read-only access to view the listing of the internal purchase invoices and line items. There are two modules in this applet which are ‘Internal Purchase Invoice’ and ‘Line Items’. This Applet can be installed from the Applet Store on akaun.com. It can be used by any supplier of a BigLedger client as long as they have registered an account on akaun.com, thus allowing them to enjoy the benefit of checking all outstanding invoices created by their customers in one place.
