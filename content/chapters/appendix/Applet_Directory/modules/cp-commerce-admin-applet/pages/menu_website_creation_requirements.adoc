== 1.0 Requirements Before Creating a Website

Before you can begin website creation in the CP-Commerce Admin Applet, you will first need to create a pricing scheme in the Doc Item Maintenance Applet **(Step 1)**, then create a company in the Organization Applet **(Step 2)**, and lastly, create a member class in the Membership Admin Applet **(Step 3)**. You have to link the information above in the CP-Commerce Admin Applet when you create your website, so each step is compulsory. This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions to perfect your website creation. Let us get started!

1. This step is quite simple. First, click on the **Member Class** menu, and then create a membership class.
2. Fill in the blank fields with a code and a name you would like to call your members, and then create. The membership class code has to be named the same as the membership class name.
3. The member class code is later needed during website creation in the CP-Commerce Admin Applet. This is so that you can assign your customers to different ranks or reward them with membership points when they purchase from your website.
4. After completing the creation of the member class and fulfilling all requirements, let us proceed to the website creation process.
