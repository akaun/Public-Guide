= 2.0 Websites Creation

It is important to note that creating a website that reflects your nature of business is crucial, as it will leave an impression on website visitors and customers. The information on your website has to be relevant to establish credibility and trust because it demonstrates that your website is authoritative and knowledgeable about the industry or niche you operate in. 

Now that you have met all of the requirements, let us begin with the steps on how to create a website using our CP-Commerce Admin Applet.

1. In the CP-Commerce Admin Applet, go to the website menu and click on “+” button. A tab to create a website will appear, and you may fill in the necessary information.

2. *Website Code:* The website code is how you want your website URL to appear when customers search for your website on any search engine. Do note that you cannot change the website code after you have clicked on “CREATE.”

3. *Website Title:* Enter the name of your website here in the space provided. It is important that the title of your website correspond with the name of your company.

4. *Branch:* For the branch, select the branch that you have created for your company in the Organization Applet. You must select the right branch if you have multiple branches, as the prices of products might vary from one branch to another.

5. *Pricing and Pricing Scheme:* In the pricing dropdown, choose “PRICING_SCHEME.” Then, an option for a pricing scheme will appear below. You have to choose the “CP-COMMERCE” pricing scheme that you have created in the Doc Item Maintenance Applet. This is to ensure that your items' prices will be linked to the CP-Commerce website.

When users want to upload new images on their website, they can click on the + sign to bring them to a new page.

2. Key Size: There are four key sizes; 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.
