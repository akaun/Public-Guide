An internal purchase return applet is a process within a business that allows for the return of purchased items or products to the company. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as defective products, incorrect items received, or overstocked inventory. The Internal Purchase Return Applet is used to add one or many internal purchase Returns. It is used to manage the listing of the internal purchase Return and line items. An internal purchase return applet can help a company maintain accurate inventory records, reduce waste, and ensure customer satisfaction. There are two modules in the applet which are ‘Internal Purchase Return’ and ‘Line Items’.
