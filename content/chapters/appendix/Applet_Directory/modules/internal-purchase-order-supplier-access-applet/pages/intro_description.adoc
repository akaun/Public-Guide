The Internal Purchase Order Supplier Access Applet is used by suppliers to view finalised purchase orders created by the customers. It gives the overview of read-only access to view the listing of the internal purchase invoices and line items. There are three menus in this applet which are ‘Purchase Order’, ‘Line Items’ and ‘PO Detailed Export’. One can download this Applet from the akaun.com Applet Store. Any supplier of a BigLedger client may utilize it as long as they have formed an account on akaun.com, giving them the advantage of viewing all pending orders made by their clients in a single location.
