_5.3(a)  For Whatsapp Twilio Predefined messages:_

    * [Compulsory] After approval by Twilio Whatsapp on the submitted template messages, the admin user is still required to set up the approved template message manually in the predefined message settings in UCC applet.

_4.3(b) For any predefined messages in all channels:_

    * [Optional] After setting up in predefined message settings, the admin user needs to tie the predefined messages to the virtual contact in virtual contact settings. Under the predefined messages tab in the virtual contact settings, the admin can tie with the automated greeting event. (screenshot 4.3)
    * None (By default)
    ** If none is selected, it means that the predefined message would not be sent out as an automated message by the system and can only be sent out manually by the agents. 
    * New Session
    ** If this option is selected, it means that the predefined message would be sent out as an automated message by the system and can also be sent out manually by the agents if the condition of “New Session” is met. _(For example, if the predefined message is an auto-reply message and the conversation is a new session opened from the end customer after which the last conversation is ended, then this new session would trigger the auto-reply predefined message which is set to be automated to be sent out in the new session.)_
    * New Conversation
    ** If this option is selected, it means that the predefined message would be sent out as an automated message by the system and can also be sent out manually by the agents if the condition of “New Conversation” is met. _(For example, if the predefined message is an auto-reply message and the conversation is a new conversation initiated from the end customer in the channel, then this new conversation would trigger the auto-reply predefined message which is set to be automated to be sent out in the new conversation.)_
    * Idle Time
    ** If this option is selected, it means that the predefined message would be sent out as an automated message by the system and can also be sent out manually by the agents if the condition of “Idle Time” and “Idle Time In Days” are met. _(For example, if the condition of the predefined message is set to be “Idle Time” and “Idle Time In Days” is 2 days in the automated greeting event setting, the initiated conversation from the end customer after idle for 2 days would trigger the predefined message to be sent out automatically by the system.)_
