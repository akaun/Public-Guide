3- PM to request from client PIC for an email listing of the admin users and agents. PM to guide them how to sign up via Akaun Shell and verify their login via email. Once this is done, PM to get Lina / tech team to provide the necessary permission for admin users to do the UCC setup in the production environment. 

NOTE: once Lina completes the permission template implementation in UCC applet, then the above section 3 is not required anymore as client PIC/admin users can do the permission assignment from their side. 
Please always follow up with Lina for the latest update on this permission part beforehand.
