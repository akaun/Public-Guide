An Internal Goods Dispatch Note Applet is designed to facilitate the management and tracking of internal goods dispatch within an organization. It allows users to create and track dispatch notes for the movement of goods from one department or location to another. This applet provides a tracking system to monitor the movement of goods throughout the dispatch process. This may include assigning unique identifiers to dispatch notes and updating their status as they progress from one stage to another.
