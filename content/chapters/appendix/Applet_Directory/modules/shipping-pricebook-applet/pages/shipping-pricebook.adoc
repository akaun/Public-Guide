image::4-ShippingPricebookEdit-Details.png[Edit Details, aign = "center"]

In order to edit the existing record of a shipping pricebook, users can click onto the particular shipping pricebook record in the Shipping Pricebook Listing page. This will open “Shipping Pricebook Edit” page. This page includes 2 tabs “Details” and “Pricing Set”

Users can edit all the information in the details tab (Name, Calculation Logic, Status and Description) of the Shipping Pricebook, except the Pricebook Code information. This is because the Pricebook Code is an important identifier and its value is unique and immutable. 

Next, the calculation logic column is very important because it determines the logic in which the Shipping Pricebook applet selects the pricesets under a pricebook to be used. For example, if the calculation logic selected is “SEQUENTIAL MATCH”, the applet will choose the pricesets under the particular pricebook based on ascending order of the priority level of its pricesets. 

Then, users click on the “SAVE” button on top right to save all the changes.

== 2.4 Delete the Pricebook Record

== 2.5 Create New Priceset under Pricebook Tab

Generally, a pricebook consists of one or multiple pricing sets. A pricing set determines a specific pricing logic. Customers can configure if they want to set a special price for any item or if they want to give a discount to certain types of customers (e.g. VIP customers), or not charge shipping fee for any products or to a certain location or any other reason to have a difference in pricing fee. All this can be managed in the “pricing set” tab.

There are 2 ways to create a priceset for a particular pricebook. Users can create a priceset for a selected pricebook in the Shipping Pricebook tab as shown below or create a priceset for a pricebook in the Shipping Priceset tab which will be explained later.
