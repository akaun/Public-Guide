The "Payment Config" tab is required for refund cases when the payment goes straight to the customer. However, this tab is created mainly because there is a link between this tab and Multi-Level Marketing Applet. This Applet works as a referral program where it allows customers to earn commissions if they succeed in referring their close family members or friends to become customers themselves. This tab also allows E-mandate. Customers" credit cards would be set with auto-detection where it would deduct some recurring payment from their credit cards every month. Users could press on the "+" sign to create a new payment config.
