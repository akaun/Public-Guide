[#h2_authoring_directory_structure]
=== Understanding the Directory Structure

|===

| Folder Name | Description

| bin
| This folder contains shell scripts that you need to install and setup. You will also see a file called publish.sh , and this is the file that you would execute to compile the asciidoc into various file formats, and save them in the "build/blg_handbook/www" folder. You shouldn't be editing any files in this folder.

| build
| This is a temporary folder that gets deleted and re-created every time we "compile" the documentation. You shouldn't need to mess with files in this folder.

| content
| This is where you will be contributing by editing the files in this folder.

| docs
| You shouldn't need to edit any files in this folder. But you are welcome to open the files in this folder to check the "compiled output" of your changes , to ensure they are correct before pushing your code to the github, and request for your branch to be merged with the "main" branch in github.

|===

[#h2_authoring_images]
=== Images 

You may place the images anywhere in any sub-folders inside the "content/" folder, and reference to it in your asciidoc document using assets/<image-file-name>. The *bin/publish.sh* would copy all images in the "content" folder into the "content/assets" folder before the compilation and build of all asciidoctor formats.

Example:
[source,asciidoc]
------
    image::assets/<image-file-name>[]
------

[#h2_committing_changes_to_the_repo]
=== Committing Changes To The Repository

Before you make any changes, it is absolutely important that you *checkout* the local repository into a different branch, and the naming convention that we use would be:

YYYY-<email_address>

You may find the following resource useful:

* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20and%20checkout,tags%20in%20the%20current%20repository.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9-iaXfKY5g

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5BLEPhqxe8

* https://www.jasongaylord.com/blog/2020/07/08/create-delete-branches-using-visual-studio-code 

Once you have made the changes you want, remember to run the command from the "Public-Guide" directory:


[source,shell]
----
bin/publish.sh
----

The above shell script will clean up the "docs" and "build" folders, and then compile all the adoc files into the intermediate "build/blg_handbook/www" folder, and you can open this folder to view the results.

* index.html (This is the multipage html output)
* blg_handbook.pub
* blg_handbook.pdf
* blg_handbook.html

Once you have completed your editing, the next step is to create a *pull request*. Refer to the following for more information:

*  https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models
*  https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests
*  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa1wXWeH1IQ

Congratulations !! 

[source,shell]
----
bin/make.sh
----

This command is more or less like publish.sh, the only difference is , it would compile and store the files into the "docs" folder. For authors that are NOT do not have the permission to manage the "main" branch, do not use this option.


[#h2_authoring_deployment_to_s3_bucket]
=== Deployment to s3 bucket

The domain name is currently hosted in the "Akaun-production" AWS s3 bucket. It has been configured in such a way that whenever there's a commit to the Github main branch https://github.com/akaun/Public-Guide/tree/main , a github action would be executed to copy the files in "docs" folder to the s3 bucket.

The details of the github action could be found in https://github.com/akaun/Public-Guide/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml 

The credentials of the AWS secrets can be found in https://github.com/akaun/Public-Guide/settings/secrets/actions 

Typically, only the chief author, in our case, Vincent will be the only running the "bin/make.sh", and generate the output html files, epub, pdf etc into this "docs" folder.
