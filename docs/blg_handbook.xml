<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>The very first thing that every akaun-platform users would need to have, is to sign up for and AkaunID. You can do so by visiting <link xl:href="https://akaun.com/">https://akaun.com/</link></simpara>
<section xml:id="h4_user_guide_your_akaun_id">
<title>Your AkaunID</title>
<simpara>It is important for you to understand that with a single AkaunID, it is possible for you to have multiple Sign-In methods. You could be using an email with password, a phone number with the same password, you could also be adding access keys to your AkaunID for integration purposes.</simpara>

<title>The Production, Staging and Development Environment</title>
<simpara>The very first thing to know is to understand the usage of each of the following environments.</simpara>

| <link xl:href="https://&lt;something&gt;.akaun.app">https://&lt;something&gt;.akaun.app</link>

<simpara>If you have registered an AkaunID to login to the Production environment, that doesn&#8217;t mean you have the same AkaunID registered in the Staging Environment and vice versa.</simpara>

<section xml:id="h4_user_guide_root_vs_tenant">
<title>Understanding Root vs Tenant</title>
<simpara>Within a single environment (Production vs Staging vs Development) there&#8217;s one and only one root database, and there could be MANY tenant databases.  Each user could be joining MULTIPLE tenants and they could have different "RANK" when joining each tenant, for example, OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, GUEST, VISTOR.</simpara>
<simpara>|=</simpara>
<simpara>| Rank of a users in a Tenant | Description</simpara>
<simpara>| OWNER
| The OWNER of a tenant is able to add any applets to an "applet catalog" if the person is also the owner/admin of the "applet catalog". The OWNER is able to add, remove or promote another user in the tenant to be the OWNER of the tenant. This RANK is usually granted to the business owners or MIS Manager of a company.</simpara>
<simpara>| ADMIN
| The ADMIN of a tenant can do almost everything that the OWNER can do, except adding , removing or promoting another user in the tenant to become the OWNER. This role is usually granted to the MIS Executive or managers in a company.</simpara>
<simpara>| MEMBER
| The MEMBER Rank does not entitle a user to administer the Tenants , Applet Catalogs, they can however, become the OWNER/ADMIN or MEMBER of an Applet after they installed the specific applet.
It is important to understand that the "OWNER/ADMIN of the Tenant" is NOT the same as the "OWNER/ADMIN" of the "Applet"</simpara>
<simpara>|=</simpara>

<section xml:id="h4_user_guide_applet_store">
<title>The Applet Store</title>
<simpara>By default, a newly signed up user would see the "Applet Store" (applet) upon successful login.
From the <emphasis role="strong">Applet Store</emphasis> , a user would be able to install applets in the public or private applet-catalogs.</simpara>
<simpara>It is very important for users to take note that they are able to see "RANK" tag and "TENANT" tag before installing the applet, so that they are installing the right applet for themselves.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are NOT the OWNER / ADMIN of a tenant, you can see a list of applet-catalogs and multiple applets in each of the applet-catalog and choose to install any of the applets accordingly.</simpara>

<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Understanding of the Akaun Platform is a prerequisite for successful implementation of any projects
using the BigLedger platform.</simpara>
<simpara>In this section, we are going to list down what the Platform System Administrators need to do, in order for a company to start using the Akaun-Platform.</simpara>
<section xml:id="h3_project_impl_subscription_setup">
<title>Subscription setup in Akaun Platform</title>
<simpara>The Platform System Administrator should be using the "Platform SysAdmin Applet" to create a subscription, and then add the OWNER / ADMIN of the tenants (usually the MIS Manager or business owners) as a MEMBER of this subscription. By adding a user to this subscription, he/she will be able to create new Applet Catalogs using the "Tenant Admin Applet".</simpara>
<simpara>(<emphasis>At the time of writing as per 2022-05-19, the new "Platform SysAdmin Applet" and "Tenant Admin Applet" are being redeveloped, hence, we will use the work around method to achieve this for the time being.</emphasis>)</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="h3_project_impl_tenant_setup">
<title>Tenant setup in Akaun Platform</title>
<simpara>Only the Akaun Platform system administrators (Wavelet and BigLedger employees) are able power up the tenant for you. The Platform System administrators need to ensure that when creating the Tenant, the correct subscription account is chosen.</simpara>
<simpara>Please email <link xl:href="mailto:jira-mis@wavelet.net">jira-mis@wavelet.net</link> to request for the tenant to be created.</simpara>
<simpara>(_We do not plan to allow non-System Administrators to create new tenants at the moment, because our Billing engine and FPX recurring payment authorization is not ready yet. Once these are ready, we may consider allowing businesses that have authorized us to bill and charge be able to create tenants in the "Tenant Admin Applet" _)</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="h3_project_impl_applet_catalog_setup">
<title>Applet-Catalogs</title>
<simpara>Think of applet-catalog as a collection of applets, tagged with RANK and TENANT. When the OWNER/ADMIN of the applet-catalogs can add applets to it, and they have to specify the "rank" and "tenant". This also mean, within the same applet-catalog, it is possible to include the same applet that links to different tenants.</simpara>
<simpara>The ADMIN/OWNER of the applet-catalog also need to add users to the applet-catalogs, and they can add them as OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER to the applet-catalogs. Only OWNER/ADMIN of the catalogs can manage the applet-catalog (adding / removing applets and users from the applet-catalogs).</simpara>
<simpara>All OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER of an applet-catalog can see the applets in this catalog and install these applets when they use the "Applet Store &#8658; Private"</simpara>
<simpara>When the users install applets from the "Applet Store" the RANK/TENANT tags will be applied to grant the users the respective permissions when they open the respective applet. Only the OWNER/ADMIN of the applets will be able to see and click on the "Settings" on the left handside menu of the applets to perform some further configuration for the applet. (This is not the same as the rank of the users in the applet-catalog).</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="h3_project_impl_core_module">
<title>Configuration of Core Modules</title>
<simpara>The Core Module consist of the following the main applets that are depended by all other applets. For example, in order to issue a sales invoice, we need to ensure that the Company and Branches are setup and configured, the products and services are added into the Item Maintenance applet, the employees of the company is setup so that the users can select the salesman when issuing the sales invoice.</simpara>
<simpara>The applets in
<xref linkend="h2_core_module"/>
should be installed, configured in proper sequence, before you proceed to install the other applets.</simpara>

<section xml:id="h3_user_guide_project_implementors_catalog_maintenance">
<title>Applet-Catalog Maintenance</title>
<simpara>Applet-Catalog is a curated list of applets combined with a curated list of users with permissions to install these applets in the list.
Users are able to open the Applet Store to see a list of Private Catalogs and install the applets accordingly.
Currently, only the Platform System Administrator is allowed to create the Applet-Catalogs, and add users to the</simpara>
<simpara>When adding an applet to a catalog, the Platform System administrators get to specify the tenant, rank, edition and addons. While the tenant and rank options do not affect the subscription pricing, the edition and addons determines the monthly subscription fee of the applets.</simpara>
<simpara>A tenant OWNER/ADMIN who happens to also be the ADMIN/OWNER of a Applet-Catalog is able to add/remove applets from the Applet-Catalog as well as adding or removing users from the Applet-Catalog. Typically, many catalogs would be created for the users of a tenant. In the example below, we make use of some fictitious company names for elaboration purpose.</simpara>

<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Welcome to integrate with <emphasis role="strong">Akaun Platform</emphasis>! The possibilities are endless.
This overview will cover everything you need to know to integrate
with the BigLedger Data Lake</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few ways you could integrate with the Akaun Platform:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>REST-api<?asciidoc-br?>
Ready to use, anytime.

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Webhook</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Python SDK<?asciidoc-br?>
This will only be available from 2024.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<section xml:id="h4_system_integrators_use_cases">
<title>Use cases</title>
<simpara>We work with various system integrators to integrate with Akaun Platform in the scenarios as follow:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>E-Commerce<?asciidoc-br?>
E-commerce system providers would usually integrate to synchronize the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Product Information<?asciidoc-br?>
E-Commerce would pull the the latest item code from Akaun Platform because typically, the latest information of the products (e.g. pricing, promotions etc) is maintained in the data lake.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales Order Transactions<?asciidoc-br?>
After an order is confirmed in the shopping cart, this need to be pushed into the data lake for fulfillment and delivery</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Customer Data<?asciidoc-br?>
New users (email addresses) created in the shopping cart need to be sync back to the data lake</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Stock Availability<?asciidoc-br?>
In order to prevent oversell situation where orders from the customers could not be delivered, resulting in bad customer experience, the e-commerce software will have to pull the stock availability information from the Akaun Platform.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Point of Sales<?asciidoc-br?></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Product Information<?asciidoc-br?>
Similar to e-commerce, this information should flow from the Data Lake to the Point of Sales.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales - Cash bills / Receipts<?asciidoc-br?>
Generally, Point of Sales systems would send the Sales Receipts (Cash bills) transactional information to the Akaun platform.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Customer Data<?asciidoc-br?>
This information is usually consolidated and processed in the data lake platform</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Accounting System</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales Invoices, Sales Return, Credit Notes, Receipt Vouchers<?asciidoc-br?>
As Akaun Platform is usually used for consolidating various operational data , including transactions with the customers, it is possible that these sales transactions are exported to certain accounting software for financial reporting.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Purchase Invoices, Purchase Return, Credit Notes, Payment Vouchers<?asciidoc-br?>
Likewise, transactions with the suppliers could also be exported to third party accounting system for financial reporting.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Journal Transactions<?asciidoc-br?>
As Akaun Platform is also capable of generating Journal Transactions, it is possible that instead of exporting transactional documents, only the journals are exported into third party accounting systems accordingly.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Membership Program</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Member Records<?asciidoc-br?>
The data lake contains all member records, and it is also associated with various contact channels (Facebook, Whatsapp, Telegram, email, mobile phone etc).
Third party Loyalty program could be pulling or pushing data into the Akaun Platform (both directions).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Point Transaction Lines<?asciidoc-br?>
If membership point calculations are done in the membership program, this information could be synced from the Membership program into the Akaun Platform, by doing so, businesses would be able to utilize this data in their e-commerce websites, mobile apps etc.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Membership Point Control Account
This table is used to store a list of membership points balance based on expiry dates. Internally, Akaun Platform could auto calculate and update this information and make it available for any third party loyalty program.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Latest Membership Point Balance
This table only store the latest membership point balance that is also calculated whenever new membership point transaction lines are inserted. This information could be used by Point of Sales or E-Commerce website to pull the information on a near real time basis.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Warehouse Management</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Purchase Orders<?asciidoc-br?>
Usually, the purchase orders are issued from the Akaun Platform to the suppliers, and these Purchase Orders need to be synced to the WMS so that when the suppliers deliver the goods, the users will use the Warehouse Management System to enter the records of the goods received from the supplier, and subsequently compare and check this against the Purchase Order from within the WMS software itself. So, the usual direction of syncing for Purchase Order is from the Akaun Platform to the WMS system.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Purchase - Goods Received Notes<?asciidoc-br?>
As Goods Received Notes are usually created using the WMS system, this information is synced back to the Akaun Platform as inventory stock balance calculations are done in the Akaun Platform. The Goods Received Note synced to the Akaun Platform would also be used to generate the Internal Purchase Invoice document, for Account Payable calculations, self billing, GST / VAT (taxation) purposes.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales Orders <?asciidoc-br?>
The Akaun Platform consolidates the sales orders from E-Commerce, <emphasis role="strong">Conversational commerce</emphasis> , outlets (branches), marketplaces (e.g. Lazada and Shopee etc), these orders could be sent to the Warehouse Management System for picking , packing and delivery purposes.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Human Resource</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales related data<?asciidoc-br?>
In order to calculate the sales commission, third party payroll or human resource software could extract the sales reports from the Akaun Platform for calculations and processing of payroll and automate the processes accordingly.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Identity and Access Control<?asciidoc-br?>
Whenever there&#8217;s a new employee joining or leaving, with the auto-import / export function, we would be able to ensure identity and access management could be automated.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Mobile Apps</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Statement of Account<?asciidoc-br?>
Third party mobile apps developer could potentially be pulling the statement of account of specific customer and display it in the mobile app to provide a great user experience.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Transaction history
The transaction history would include all business documents, for example, Sales Order, Sales Invoice, Sales Return, Credit Note, Purchase Order, Purchase Invoice, Payment Voucher, Credit Note etc.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Warranty Information
Given a product serial number, it is possible to pull information from the Akaun Platform on the warranty expiry date and other information that may be useful for consumers.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales Quotations
Certain quotations would need to be approved by the customers, it is possible for the mobile apps developer to obtain this information for the customers to "approve" the Sales Quotation in order for the Sales Order or Job Order to be carried out.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sales Orders
It is likely that the mobile app might want to pull information about the sales order history, and also be able to create a sales order directly into the Akaun Platform.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Product Information

<title>Stock Availability API</title>
<simpara>This api to get stock availability of the product which synced from marketplace. To get stock availability, you may refer to Ecomsync Item Api(<xref linkend="h4_system_integrators_ecomsync_item_api"/>). The stock availability is stored in bl_fi_mst_ecomsync_item_hdr.qty_balance.</simpara>
<simpara>The different between stock availability and stock balance is stock availability is the stock which can be sold to customer while stock balance is the stock which exist/hold by the branch. Meaning if the stock has been ordered(sales order created), the stock will be deducted from stock availability as it is already booked for the customer. Once sales invoice created, the stock will also be deducted from stock balance.</simpara>
<simpara>The stock balance is obtained from multiple branches which will be configured by users in organization applet.Based on this selection of branches, everytime the sales order created, the system will updated the stock availability in bl_fi_mst_ecomsync_item_hdr.qty_balance where the mkt_guid(branch/marketplace) part of branch that are configured.</simpara>

<section xml:id="h4_cpcom_mod_hostname_setup">
<title>Hostname Setup</title>
<simpara>For every website configured in the CP-Commerce Admin Applet, it is possible for our users to configure the multiple cloudfront distributions and each cloudfront distribution is linked to a certain hostnames that allow the web browser to visit these websites.</simpara>
<section xml:id="h3_cpcom_mod_platform_sub_domain">
<title>Platform Sub-Domain</title>
<simpara>A platform sub-domain for each website is constructed with the following format:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>website-code.tenant-code.akaun.net  (for production environment)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>website-code.tenant-code.akaun.app (for staging environment)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>website-code.tenant-code.akaun.xyz (for development environment)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>When you first starting a website, by default, the akaun platform would create the following hostname automatically for you using combination of tenant-code and website code. For example, if your tenant code is "mytenant" and your website code is "resellers", the CP-Commerce would create the hostname as resellers.mytenant.akaun.net.</simpara>
<simpara>This sub-domain provided by Akaun platform would be powered up immediately, so that the users of a website could visit the website right away. As the "akaun.net" DNS is hosted by us, no domain name verification or CNAME is required on your side.</simpara>

<title>Technical Background</title>
<simpara>This section is only meant for technical readers that would like to dig into the AWS cloudfront technical details of how things work:</simpara>

<simpara>We make use of DNS validation as follows:
<link xl:href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html">AWS Certificate Manager - DNS Validation</link></simpara>
<simpara>You may watch the following guide to get some basic understanding of DNS:</simpara>



</section>
<section xml:id="h3_cpcom_mod_setup_custom_domain_name">
<title>Transition and configuration of custom domain names</title>
<simpara>Assuming your company owns "mydomain.com", and you would like to implement the cp-commerce. But during the implementation, you would like to configure a temporary custom sub-domain and use it, before you make use of the top level domain name, to point to the cp-commerce website as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://newstore.mydomain.com/">https://newstore.mydomain.com/</link><?asciidoc-br?>
This sub-domain "estore" would be used for the time being, while the current website is still life and being used (Let&#8217;s say, <link xl:href="https://mydomain.com/">https://mydomain.com/</link> and <link xl:href="https://www.mydomain.com">https://www.mydomain.com</link>). This temporary hostname could be configured in advanced.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://mydomain.com/">https://mydomain.com/</link><?asciidoc-br?>
After the new website implementation is completed, and when we are ready to launch the new website, we would be getting ready to retire the old website , and configure this second hostname just like the "newstore.mydomain.com" to go live.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="_custom_sub_domain">
<title>Custom Sub-domain</title>
<simpara>At this time, the hostname can be created by the Platform SysAdmin only, using the Platform SysAdmin applet.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>In future, we may allow hostname to be created under using 2 approach:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Platform SysAdmin Applet</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>CP-Commerce Admin Applet</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</tip>
<simpara>The very first step of creating a sub-domain is to perform ACM validation. You will be given the following:</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">ACM Validation DNS Record</emphasis></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Type: CNAME</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Name: <emphasis role="strong">_7760b3c88f1556jjjjjjjjjjjjj</emphasis>.mydomain.com</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Value: <emphasis role="strong">_80fb2b1ef05e7xxxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyy.acm-validations.aws.</emphasis></simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You are required to add the above into your DNS Record.</simpara>
<simpara>After you have completed the validation of the ACM certificate, the next step is to create and configure your custom sub-domain to point to the CloudFront Distribution.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Sub-domain CNAME forwarding</emphasis></simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Type: CNAME</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Name: <emphasis role="strong">sub-domain-name</emphasis>.mydomain.com</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Record Value: <emphasis role="strong">xxxxxxxxx</emphasis>.cloudfront.net</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>That&#8217;s it, nothing more, all you need to do next is to visit <link xl:href="https://sub-domain-name.mydomain.com">https://sub-domain-name.mydomain.com</link></simpara>

<simpara>requesting for the permission template to be created for third party developer.</simpara>
<simpara>==Create Permission Templates
* Firstly, a developer needs to identify the webservices according to the CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete ) operations in an applet. To identify the webservices for the specific CRUD operation developer may use the source code or network tab in the browser&#8217;s developer tools. We will be using browser&#8217;s developer tools here.
image::network-tab.png[Developer&#8217;s tools]
* List down all the webservices for each CRUD operation separately. For example, to view the list of Internal Purchase Return Listing, these are the webservices have been used.
image::webservices-listing.png[Webservice Listing]
* Then, find the permission definitions for the listed web services. Developers use 'blg-akaun-platform-java' library to find the permission definitions. Every webservice has a controler.java file containing the permission definitions in the java library. There are permission definitions for GET, PUT, POST, DELETE operations and permissions for Admin, Owner and Users.
image::find-permission-definitions.png[Find Permission Definitions]
* List down the permission definitions for the listed webservices initially.
image::permission-definition-listing.png[Permission Definitions Listing]
permission-definition-listing
* Create Permission Templates in the 'Developer Admin' applet.
<emphasis role="strong"> Each operation should have one/multiple permission templates
</emphasis>Find your applet and create the tempaltes first. The naming conventions for a permission temaplate code should start with applet code and ends with '_PERM_TEMPLATE'
